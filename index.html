          <p>
            Virtual Internships give you the opportunity to work on real tech
            projects at RadicalX and learn about how work is done. This exposure
            is not always possible with a traditional college internship. The
            crucial work skills you develop and the work experience you acquire
            can potentially increase your earning potential.
